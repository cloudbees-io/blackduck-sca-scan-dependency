= Cloudbees action: Scan with Black Duck SCA

Use this action to scan repositories for dependency vulnerabilities with the Black Duck Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scanner.

Black Duck is a software composition analysis (SCA) scanning solution that helps organizations manage risks associated with open source software in terms of security, license compliance, and code quality.

Add a Black Duck scan to your workflows in CloudBees platform to:

* Detect open source and third-party dependencies in software, source code, and artifacts with multiple analysis techniques.
* Identify code vulnerabilities and receive timely security advisories.
* Gain insight into security risks and how to fix vulnerabilities.

CloudBees platform enables you to run a Black Duck scan either implicitly or explicitly.

== Explicit and implicit scan types

An implicit scan is automatically triggered, and an explicit scan is one you configure to be invoked in a step of your workflow.
To learn more about the differences between explicit and implicit scans, refer to link:https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-platform/latest/actions#security[].

To set up implicit scanning, refer to link:https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-platform/latest/aspm/implicit-security-analysis[].

== Scanner information

The Black Duck SCA scanner architectural components are:

* Client-side: The Black Duck Detect scanning tool, the Signature Scanner command line tool, and the REST API.
* Server-side: The Black Duck server.
* Data center: The link:https://www.blackduck.com/software-composition-analysis-tools/knowledgebase.html[Black Duck KnowledgeBase] open-source software database.

The scanning process is as follows:

. The Black Duck Detect tool is used to authenticate and initiate the code scan.
. Codebases are scanned on the client side.
. The scan data is uploaded to the Black Duck server with the Detect tool.
The completed scan data does not contain any source code, to maintain your code security.
The completed scan contains only file and directory signatures, and information derived from package management files.
. The scan data is sent to the Black Duck KnowledgeBase, and open source components in your code are matched and identified.
The matching/identification process is based on your package manager data and SHA1 hashes created by the Signature Scanner when it scans your files and directories.
. The REST API is used to fetch the bearer token and retrieve the scanning results.
. The matched open source components are reported as a viewable Bill of Materials that contains the associated security, licensing, and operational risks of the discovered components.

== Usage examples

The following is a basic usage example for this action:

[source,yaml]
----

      - name: Scan with Black Duck SCA
        uses: https://github.com/cloudbees-io/blackduck-sca-scan-dependency@v2
        with:
          server-url: ${{ vars.BLACK_DUCK_URL }}
          api-token: ${{ secrets.BLACK_DUCK_TOKEN }}
          ref: main

----

=== Using Black Duck Detect properties

In the following example, the Black Duck Detect properties `logging.level.detect` and `blackduck.offline.mode` are specified:

[source,yaml]
----

      - name: Scan with Black Duck SCA with params
        uses: https://github.com/cloudbees-io/blackduck-sca-scan-dependency@v2
        with:
          server-url: ${{ vars.BLACK_DUCK_URL }}
          api-token: ${{ secrets.BLACK_DUCK_TOKEN }}
          ref: main
          project-name: 'my-project'
          project-version: '0.0.1'
          detect-cli-params: '--logging.level.detect=DEBUG --blackduck.offline.mode=false'

----

=== Scan a C language repository with Black Duck

The following CloudBees platform workflow example scans a C++ repository with Black Duck.

[source, yaml,role="default-expanded"]
----

name: black-duck-scan
kind: workflow
apiVersion: automation.cloudbees.io/v1alpha1

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  scm-token-own: read
  scm-token-org: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  blackduck-scan:
    steps:
      - name: Check out C++ source code
        uses: cloudbees-io/checkout@v1

      - name: Black Duck scan on C++ code
        uses: cloudbees-io/blackduck-sca-scan-dependency@v2
        with:
          server-url: 'https://blackduck.example.com'
          api-token: ${{ secrets.BLACK_DUCK_API_TOKEN }}
          project-name: 'my-cpp-scan-project'
          project-version: '0.0.2'
          detect-cli-params: '--detect.clang.compile.commands.path=./compile_commands.json'

----

[IMPORTANT]
====
For all C language scans, be sure to specify the compilation database file via `+detect-cli-params: '--detect.clang.compile.commands.path=./compile_commands.json'+`.

If you do not add the compilation database file, the Black Duck scan may:

* Miss dependencies and be unable to resolve include paths and linked libraries.
* Perform incomplete analyses and not detect all components and vulnerabilities.
* Produce reduced accuracy due to a limited understanding of your project's build configuration.
* Return potential false positives or missed security issues.
